These are just a couple of new themes I made for [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp).

These are based off of my [Pastelodon](https://itc.reddmo.com/blog/pastelodon/) theme, with some minor color adjustments. In both, I pared down the number of colors used. In Bomb Pop, I used a darker background than int he Pastelodon Dark theme. I thought the variations were enough to warrant new names. You can judge that.

P.S. The framed screenshot above was created using Federico Viticci's [Apple Frames 3.1 shortcut/API](https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-frames-3-1-extending-screenshot-automation-with-the-new-apple-frames-api/) for framing screenshots. I highly recommend it if you do that regularly.
