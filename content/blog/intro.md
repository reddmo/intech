This is the first post. The intention is for this blog to be an intersection of many interests of mine. My About Me, which will be expanded, touches upon some of these but there will inevitably be topics unaddressed there.

Right now, this is me testing my new setup using @11ty and Netlify. I think this will be a nice setup but I am teaching myself it on the fly. It took a few takes to figure out that I didn't need as many of the changes as I needed to where I did.

In any event, look for more to come.
