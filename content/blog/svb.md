If you've follow tech and/or finance news, you certainly haven't missed the stories of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But, just in case:

*[NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/11/technology/silicon-valley-bank-crypto-investing.html)
*[NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/03/10/1162599556/silicon-valley-bank-collapse-failure-fdic-regulators-run-on-bank)

There are going to be plenty of stories over the coming days of what, why, how it happened. And I certainly feel for the startups and small companies that had funding tied up with SVB because its going to impact those companies and their employees much worse than the large companies and VCs.

That said, this one's an intersection of my professional life and personal hobbies. I follow tech and finance news in my personal life because I'm interested in it. But in my professional life, I am the main administer and point-of-contact for our pension fund.

As the SVB news was breaking this week and particularly when the FDIC took it over, my personal hobby brain was fascinated by the news (not in a good/bad way, just out of pure interest), but my professional brain went to, "What's the short- and long-term effects of this on our pension?"

I don't have reason to believe that we had investments directly with SVB, though still to be determined. However, the wider impact of SVB's collapse on the tech industry, where we most likely do have investments, is a concern. And we're not alone.

This, I think, is where patience is needed. Panicking now could result in the exact things everyone's starting to fear as they reflect on SVB compared to the 2008 banking industry collapse. Panicking (and perhaps some other motives) are what lead to the sudden SVB collapse.

I did contact our investment managers. Time, conversations, and maybe some tough decisions (again, time will tell) are going to answer the questions for our particular pension fund. How others fare is also yet to be determined.

In the meantime, think of those folks who are feeling the immediate impacts of the collapse (employees, small startups, etc.).
