I didn't expect my second post to be a theme for a Mastodon app but after messing with the custom theme creator in [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp), I was intrigued by the possibilities of the theme creator.

At first, it started with some variations on other colors. Stark black background, vibrant pinks, purples, and blues. But the contrast was getting to me. It was almost too bright, even in Dark Mode. Then I came across an interesting post somewhere - and I apologize to the OP because I don't recall who it was - that redrew my attention to [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin).

I started down a rabbit hole at that point. I liked the pastel colors but - and more importantly - the contrasts weren't as stark and didn't strain my eyes as much.

After creating the theme, I decided I liked it so much that ... well, look around. This blog is now themed in the same color palette.

Anyway, feel free to download the theme, Light and Dark linked below. If I edit the theme more, I will update the links here. I may make variations of it as well.

P.S. The framed screenshot above was created using Federico Viticci's [Apple Frames 3.1 shortcut/API](https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-frames-3-1-extending-screenshot-automation-with-the-new-apple-frames-api/) for framing screenshots. I highly recommend it if you do that regularly.
